# Setup and Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up the development environment, building, and running the Minecraft Clone project.

## System Requirements

*   **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
*   **Compiler:** A C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
*   **Build System:** CMake 3.10 or later.
*   **Graphics:** Hardware with OpenGL 3.3 support or higher.

## Dependencies

*   **GLFW:** For window creation and input handling. (Installation instructions will vary by OS)
*   **GLAD:** To load OpenGL function pointers. (Will be included or fetched by CMake)
*   **GLM:** For mathematics (vectors, matrices). (Will be included or fetched by CMake)
*   *(Other dependencies will be added as the project progresses)*

## Setup Instructions

*(Detailed, OS-specific instructions will be added here. For now, a general outline.)*

1.  **Install a C++ Compiler:**
    *   **Windows:** Install Visual Studio with the C++ workload, or MinGW/MSYS2 for GCC.
    *   **macOS:** Install Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
    *   **Linux:** Install `build-essential` (or equivalent) and `g++` or `clang`.

2.  **Install CMake:** Download from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/) or use a package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install cmake` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install cmake` on macOS).

3.  **Install GLFW:**
    *   **Windows:** Download pre-compiled binaries from [glfw.org](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) or build from source. Ensure the library files are accessible to your compiler/linker.
    *   **macOS:** `brew install glfw`
    *   **Linux:** `sudo apt install libglfw3-dev` (or equivalent for your distribution).

4.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace with actual URL once available
    cd minecraft-clone
    ```

## Build Process

*(General CMake build steps. Specifics might be added based on project structure)*

1.  **Create a build directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

2.  **Configure the project with CMake:**
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
    *   On Windows with Visual Studio, you might need to specify the generator, e.g., `cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"`

3.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```
    *   Or, on Linux/macOS, simply `make` after `cmake ..` if using Makefiles.
    *   On Windows with Visual Studio, you can open the generated `.sln` file in the `build` directory and build from there.

4.  **Run the executable:** The executable will typically be found in the `build` directory or a subdirectory like `build/Debug` or `build/Release`.

## Troubleshooting

*(Common issues and solutions will be added here.)*

*   **CMake errors:** Ensure CMake is installed correctly and in your system's PATH. Check for missing dependencies.
*   **Compiler errors:** Ensure your compiler supports C++17. Check for syntax errors or missing headers.
*   **Linker errors:** Ensure all required libraries (like GLFW) are correctly installed and linked.

## Configuration Options

*(Details on how to configure game settings, render distance, etc., will be added here.)*

## Testing Instructions

*(Instructions to verify correct installation and basic functionality will be added here.)*
