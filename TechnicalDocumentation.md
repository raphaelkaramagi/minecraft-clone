# Technical Documentation

## 1. Architecture Overview

*(This section will describe the high-level architecture of the game, detailing the major systems and their interactions. It will be updated as the systems are designed and implemented.)*

### Core Systems (Planned):

*   **Rendering System:** Responsible for all visual output, including block rendering, skybox, lighting, and UI elements. Will use OpenGL.
*   **World Management System:** Handles procedural world generation (chunks, biomes), block data, saving/loading world state.
*   **Physics System:** Manages collision detection, gravity, and object movement.
*   **Entity Management System:** Tracks and updates all dynamic entities in the game (player, mobs, items).
*   **Input System:** Processes keyboard, mouse (and potentially controller) input for player actions and UI interaction.
*   **Audio System:** Manages sound effects, ambient sounds, and background music.
*   **UI System:** Implements all user interfaces (main menu, inventory, crafting, HUD).
*   **Game Logic System:** Contains the rules of the game, crafting recipes, mob AI, day/night cycle logic, etc.
*   **Resource Management System:** Loads, caches, and manages game assets (textures, sounds, models, configurations).

## 2. API Documentation

*(This section will provide documentation for the public APIs of major modules and components as they are developed. This will help with maintainability and future development.)*

## 3. Performance Optimization Guide

*(This section will document performance considerations, profiling techniques used, and specific optimizations implemented in different parts of the game.)*

## 4. Known Limitations and Future Enhancements

*(This section will list any known limitations of the current implementation and ideas for future features or improvements.)*
