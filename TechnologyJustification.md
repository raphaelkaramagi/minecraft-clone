# Technology Justification

This document outlines the technology choices made for the Minecraft Clone project.

## Programming Language: C++

*   **Justification:** C++ offers the high performance and low-level control necessary for a demanding 3D game like Minecraft. Its extensive libraries and strong community support for game development (especially with graphics APIs like OpenGL/Vulkan) make it a robust choice. While languages like C# or Java offer faster development cycles, C++ provides the raw power needed for complex simulations (physics, large worlds) and fine-grained memory management, which are critical for this project. Rust is a strong contender for memory safety and performance, but the C++ ecosystem for game development is currently more mature and offers a wider range of established libraries and learning resources.

## Graphics API: OpenGL (with GLFW for windowing and GLM for math)

*   **Justification:** OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics API that provides a good balance between control and ease of use. It's widely supported and has a wealth of learning resources. While Vulkan offers more direct hardware control and potentially higher performance, its learning curve is significantly steeper, which could slow down initial development. DirectX is Windows-specific, limiting cross-platform compatibility. GLFW is a lightweight, cross-platform library for creating windows and handling input, and GLM provides a good set of mathematics utilities commonly used in graphics programming. This combination allows for rapid iteration while maintaining good performance and portability.

## Build System: CMake

*   **Justification:** CMake is a cross-platform build system generator that is widely used in C++ projects. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies and building the project on different operating systems and compilers.
